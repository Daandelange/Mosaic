# Mosaic plugin system

Based on [PLUGG](http://pugg.sourceforge.net/) C++ cross-platform plugin system

If you want to contribute to the Mosaic objects library with now ones, you can write a plugin, compile it as a shared library (.bundle on OSX, .so on linux and .dll on windows), and just distribute your lib.
Leaving in this folder the shared libraries, will automatically load the new objects included at runtime.

To start, just clone this repo:

https://github.com/d3cod3/Mosaic-Plugin

you'll find there a template to write Mosaic plugins.
