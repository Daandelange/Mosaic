# OF COMPATIBLE RELEASE

## 0.10.1 STABLE (official download from [OF site](https://openframeworks.cc/))
> Compiled/tested with QTCreator on osx/linux/windows

If you want to build Mosaic, just download OF0.10.0 for your OS (osx, linux, windows) and follow the setup guide for [qtcreator](https://www.qt.io/) IDE.

# DESCRIPTION

![Mosaic-Data-Flow-Diagram](https://github.com/d3cod3/Mosaic/raw/master/process/img/10_Mosaic-Data-Flow-Diagram.jpg)

Mosaic is an open source multi-platform (osx, linux, windows) live coding and visual programming application, based on openFrameworks.

This project deals with the idea of integrate/amplify human-machine communication, offering a real-time flowchart based visual interface for high level creative coding. As live-coding scripting languages offer a high level coding environment, ofxVisualProgramming and the Mosaic Project as his parent layer container, aim at a high level visual-programming environment, with embedded multi scripting languages availability (Lua, GLSL, Python and BASH(macOS & linux) ).

As this project is based on openFrameworks, one of the goals is to offer as more objects as possible, using the pre-defined OF classes for trans-media manipulation (audio, text, image, video, electronics, computer vision), plus all the gigantic ofxaddons ecosystem actually available (machine learning, protocols, web, hardware interface, among a lot more).

While the described characteristics could potentially offer an extremely high complex result (OF and OFXADDONS ecosystem is really huge, and the possibility of multiple scripting languages could lead every unexperienced user to confusion), the idea behind the interface design aim at avoiding the "high complex" situation, embodying a direct and natural drag&drop connect/disconnet interface (mouse/trackpad) on the most basic level of interaction, adding text editing (keyboard) on a intermediate level of interaction (script editing), following most advanced level of interaction for experienced users (external devices communication, automated interaction, etc...)

# COMPILING

## LINUX

### The easy way

Here you can download (and check) a script for automatically download/clone/compile and build everything, and magically have Mosaic appearing on your desktop menu and perfectly working.

    -   [Ubuntu](https://gist.github.com/d3cod3/81b8971ebf5fc9a6d288ca93fc3c3dad#file-install_mosaic_ubuntu-sh)
    -   Debian (SOON)

###Â The manual way

Compiling with [qtcreator 4.6.1](https://download.qt.io/official_releases/qtcreator/4.6/4.6.1/) with some issues, check this OF commit [openframeworks/openFrameworks@8407701](https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/commit/84077013d8a9c482696af18777a4e6976afe970c) and this [issue #3487](https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/3487).

For the issue (an incompatibility between gtk3 and the ofxOpenCv addon) you'll need to uninstall libgtk-3-dev

```bash
sudo apt-get remove libgtk-3-dev
```

and follow the instructions here [Mosaic issue #1](https://github.com/d3cod3/Mosaic/issues/1).

Then, due to poco library compatibility, starting from ubuntu 18.04 or debian 9, in order to compile it you'll need to install libpoco-dev:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libpoco-dev
```

And fix your copy of **ofxPoco**, where basically you'll need to remove the static libs in **libs/poco/lib** folder and substitute the **poco/include/Poco** folder with the headers installed in your system, usually installed in **/usr/local/include**.

## MACOS

Compiling with [qtcreator 4.6.1](https://download.qt.io/official_releases/qtcreator/4.6/4.6.1/) with no issues.

## WINDOWS

Compiling with [qtcreator 4.6.1](https://download.qt.io/official_releases/qtcreator/4.6/4.6.1/) with no issues.
